# npm Private Modules Terms

These npm Private Modules Terms of Use (these _npm Private Modules
Terms_) supplement the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc.
(_npm_) at <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm
Open Source Terms_). They govern access to and use of _npm Private
Modules_, the personal private package storage and delivery features of
<https://www.npmjs.com> (the _Website_) and the npm public registry at
<https://registry.npmjs.com> (the _Public Registry_).

These npm Private Modules Terms were last updated on
November 17, 2015. You can review prior versions at

You may only access or use npm Private Modules by agreeing to the npm

npm adds any additional functionality to npm Private Modules, you must
agree to these npm Private Modules Terms to use those new features, too.
You add these npm Private Modules Terms to your agreement with npm by
clicking a check box when enabling npm Private Modules for your account
on the Website (your _Account_). These npm Private Modules Terms then
become a part of the contract between you and npm, until you or npm
disable npm Private Modules for your Account.
