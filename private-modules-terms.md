# npm Private Modules Terms

These npm Private Modules Terms of Use (these _npm Private Modules
Terms_) supplement the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc.
(_npm_) at <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm
Open Source Terms_). They govern access to and use of _npm Private
Modules_, the personal private package storage and delivery features of
<https://www.npmjs.com> (the _Website_) and the npm public registry at
<https://registry.npmjs.com> (the _Public Registry_).

These npm Private Modules Terms were last updated on November 9, 2015.

You may only access or use npm Private Modules by agreeing to the npm

clicking a check box when enabling npm Private Modules for your account
on the Website (your _Account_). These npm Private Modules Terms then
become a part of the contract between you and npm, until you or npm
