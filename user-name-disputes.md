# User Names: Dispute Resolution

This document describes the steps that you should take to resolve user name
disputes with other registered npm users.

This document is a clarification of the acceptable behavior outlined in
the [npm Code of Conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct), and
nothing in this document should be interpreted to contradict any aspect
of the npm Code of Conduct.

## Steps to Take

1. Get the email associated with the desired user name from the profile
   page: `https://www.npmjs.com/~<user_name>`
2. Email the author, CC <support@npmjs.com>
3. After a few weeks, if there's no resolution, the npm support team
  will work with you to reach one.

## Description

As our community grows, so does the number of claimed user names or scopes.
Occasionally, a user tries to create a new personal user account or
organization, only to discover that the desired scope has already been
taken.

1. Ricardo creates a personal user account, `coolestname`, planning to
   become active within the JavaScript community. They start, but soon
   move on to other platforms leaving their user account unused. Some time
   later, Irina comes along and wants to use the `coolestname` name as it
   matches what they use elsewhere.
2. Ricardo creates a personal user account, `nextbiggestthing`. They're
   not attached to the name, but thought it would be popular someday. 
   Later, Irina attempts to create an organization with the
   `nextbiggestthing` scope matching their company name, Next Biggest
   Thing Co.

Irina's claims to the already uses scopes is debatable, but their course
of action is the same.

1. When alerted that a scope has already been taken it could be one
  of two things:
  
    A. **User Scope**: A profile page of an existing user account will
      give Irina the email address of the owner of the user name 
      `https://www.npmjs.com/~<user_name>`.
    B **Organization Scope**: If no profile with the name you are trying
      to use exists, it's likely that the name is associated with an
      organization scope. You'll need to reach out to the support team
      <support@npmjs.com> to identify the organization super-admin and
      associated email.

2. Write an email:
    - explaining the terms of her claim to the name
    - CC's npm support staff <support@npmjs.com>

3. After a reasonable amount of time, if Ricardo has not responded, or if
   Ricardo and Irina can't come to any sort of resolution, support
   <support@npmjs.com> will follow up to help moderate and move the
   conversation. ("Reasonable" is usually at least 4 weeks.)
  
## Power to the People

In most cases so far, the parties involved have been able to
reach an amicable resolution without any major intervention.  Most
people really do want to be reasonable, and are probably not even
aware that they're in your way.

When humans solve their problems by talking to other humans with
respect, everyone has the chance to end up feeling good about the
interaction.

## Exceptions

Some things are not allowed.
