# npm, Inc.'s Recruiting Process

This document was once an internal document at npm, Inc.  Because it
is relevant to many people in our community, and we like transparency,
we have decided to open it up to the world.

There is no expectation or requirement that *you* hire people in this
way if you are not working at npm, Inc.  This is just how we do it.
If you [apply for a job here](https://www.npmjs.com/jobs), this may
provide some clue as to what to expect.

From here on out, "you" refers to the npm, Inc. employee who is
evaluating candidates for hire.

## npm's hiring philosophy

npm has a great brand for recruitment. Our applicants generally
mention three things they particularly like:

- Our focus on work-life balance and a humane working environment
- Caring about diversity
- That our product is open source

None of these things have anything to do with node.js or JavaScript,
and that's a great sign. Your conversations with applicants should
communicate the value we place on these things.

## Writing the job description

Some simple guidelines:

- Keep a conversational tone. Imagine you were describing the job to
  somebody over IM. This is not a contract.
- Maintain a bias towards inclusion. Applying for jobs is scary and
  hard work, so people read job descriptions looking for the *first
  thing that disqualifies them* so they don't need to apply. Don't
  give them this opportunity. *The purpose of a job description is to
  persuade someone to apply*, not to scare them off.
- Don't list a qualification (e.g. a degree) as required unless it
  really is required (we do not require degrees).
- Likewise, don't list a qualification if it is "nice to have". If we
  get a lot of applicants, then we'll screen for stuff that is nice to
  have after we get their resumes.
- Do not include a laundry list of technologies or applications. Any
  smart hire will be able to learn these.
- Talk about how the role will grow, and opportunities for training
  and mentorship. The number one thing people look for in a job is the
  opportunity to be better at it.
- Avoid [aggressive
  language](https://storify.com/kissane/job-listings-that-don-t-alienate)
  of any kind.
- Gendered language is obviously a no-go, and consider if your
  language is ageist or otherwise biased.

We have an [open source repo](https://github.com/npm/jobs) of former
job descriptions to help you.

## How we interview

Read [Laurie's blog post on
hiring](http://seldo.com/weblog/2014/08/26/you_suck_at_technical_interviews)
for all the things *not* to do. The remainder of this section assumes
you've read this post.

We are looking for people who:

- can grasp complex technical subjects, because our product is one of
  those
- can clearly explain those subjects to others, because simplifying
  the complex is what we do
- can get things done, the best indicator of this being having already
  done things
- can quickly learn how to do this job; they don't need to already
  know how to do it
- show signs that they will get better at this job, i.e. future growth
  potential

npm values transparency and humanity, so as much as possible our
interviews are transparent and humane. Interviews are inherently
uncomfortable and scary, and nobody sounds smart when they are
uncomfortable and scared. Do your best to compensate for this. If you
think the candidate is doing well, be liberal about saying so. If the
candidate makes a mistake, try to prevent them spiralling into
meltdown by moving on quickly or giving positive feedback about some
other aspect of their performance.

Your interview should be a conversation. You are not trying to prove
that you know more about a topic than they do. You are not trying to
quiz them to make sure they know everything about a specific topic or
technology. You want to know if they can grasp complex concepts and
explain them clearly, because that is what a knowledge worker does.

## Step-by-step hiring process

Role is identified.

Hiring Manager writes job description.

As resumes come into jobs@npmjs.com (https://www.npmjs.com/jobs) and
hiring@npmjs.com (https://www.npmjs.com/hiring), HR will upload to and
update [Lever](https://hire.lever.co/).  It is the responsibility
ofthe hiring manager to review resumes on a timely basis and if there
are obvious "NO's" to let HR know immediately so the candidates can
move forward with their job search.

Everyone who speaks to a candidate must put their notes in
[Lever](https://hire.lever.co/). The #recruitment channel on slack is
for discussing hiring pipeline status and recruitment plans, not
individual candidates. (i.e. it's okay to ask "is Jane coming for an
interview?" but not "I didn't like Jane because...").

### Job Description and Initial Selection

Post the job description by adding it to the [job descriptions
repository](https://github.com/npm/job-descriptions) and the [static
pages job
page](https://github.com/npm/static-pages/blob/master/jobs.md).

In some cases, we may choose to post the job to other locations than
just our own website (especially for non-engineering roles, where
skilled candidates may not be npm users).

Wait at least 2 weeks after posting a job description before screening
(don't screen as you go; screen as a batch).  This prevents us from
unfairly privileging those who come in earlier by virtue of the fact
that we look at them longer.

All incoming applicants MUST be put into Lever. If you receive one in
your personal email account, please put into Lever and let HR know.
This ensures that every application gets a personal response
indicating we received it and a rough timeline for screening (e.g.
"about 1 week from now").

Hiring manager will read all available resumes and select 25-50% of
those candidates for first-round screening. Anybody not selected is
notified at this stage by HR.

- Did you leave the job description up for 2 weeks?
- Did you get enough applicants to be confident that we'll find
  someone who's a good fit?
- Is the pool of applicants demographically diverse?  (If not,
  this could indicate non-inclusive signals in the job description
  that will prevent talented people from applying!)

### First and Second Screen

First-round screening is an informal, 20-30 minute discussion, by
phone, Skype, or Google Hangout by the hiring manager, who will select
roughly 50% of these candidates for second-round screens.  Anybody not
selected is notified at this stage by HR.

Second-round screening is 2 longer conversations, 45-60 minutes, by
phone or google hangout if the applicant is remote, or in-person if
they are local. Hiring Manager will determine which prospective
team-mates, or existing employees with relevant skillsets will be
taking part in second-round conversations. For remote applicants
always supply the phone number or google hangout name
*applicant-interviewer* in the calendar invitation. Anybody not
selected for this stage will be notified by HR.

- Did the candidate get a chance to talk to 2 members of the team?
- Did we find people whose career goals are aligned with the needs of
  this role?
- Were there at least some individuals who clearly stood out from the
  crowd?  (If not, we could be lacking clarity on the job needs, or
  just trying to "make it work" with a pool of applicants who are all
  not right for the role.)

### Full Team Interview

After the second round interviews, hiring manager meets with
interviewers to select 1-3 candidates for a full team interview.

Often by this point there will be one obviously best candidate, and it
is fine to bring them in by themselves. Candidates not selected for
the final round are notified at this stage by HR.

Full team interview: the candidate comes in for lunch at noon (any
day except Monday). The hiring manager will invite 6 staff members
that the candidate is likely to be in contact with during their
day.

After lunch, anyone who hasn't yet spoken with the candidate, and the
hiring manager deems necessary may request a 30-45 minute slot.  For
remote candidates after their flight, hotel etc. have been arranged HR
will send them their itinerary and cc hiring manager, with a short
"this might come in handy" note containing at least one contact number
for emergencies and local cab or other transit options.

Important: interviewers should not discuss their reactions with other
interviewers until *after* they've all had a chance to speak with the
candidate.  The goal is to get everyone's authentic assessment and
surface any concerns, not to just make the case for your personal
favorite!  Put your own notes in lever before discussing with anyone
else, or reading their notes.

- Is the candidate eager to do this specific job?
- Did everyone get a chance to bring up and discuss any concerns that
  they have about the candidate or their fit with this role?
- Is there another team that the candidate would prefer to be on?  (If
  we think there might be, have we checked?)
- Were there any extenuating circumstances that we should take into
  account that might have put the candidate at a disadvantage?

### Final Selection

After the full team interview, hiring manager and their team will take
everyone's notes into account and make a final decision.  After
selecting the best candidate, we do *not* yet notify the other
candidates.

Reference checks: The candidate supplies 3 names and contact
information of people they have worked directly with; hiring manager
has a discussion with at least 2. This is a final red-flag check and
also gives the hiring manager a head-start on how to work best with
the hire.  **Questions can include** What dates did the candidate work
there?  What is the documented departure reason?  Would you rehire?

It's extremely rare that reference checking will ever uncover a
serious dealbreaker.  It's more a gut-check to make sure that we are
setting the employee up to succeed.

Hiring manager will consult with the selected candidate on salary,
benefits, relocation, visa (at the moment npm lacks the legal
resources to sponsor visas other than TN-1 visas for Canadian and
Mexican citizens), and any other issues to make sure there are no
unexpected barriers to a hire and a reasonable start date, and make a
salary recommendation to the CEO.

- Have we identified specific reasons why this candidate is the best
  choice for this role, moreso than other candidates who made it this
  far?
- Did we remember to check references, and did they bring up any
  surprises?
- Are we excited and eager to start working with them?
- Can we clearly understand what they add that the company needs?
- Is the offer fair and commensurate with other employees at the same
  level?
- Do we need to adjust our other open job listings now that this
  person is part of the team?

### Offer and On-Boarding

CEO will have a final conversation with the candidate, make salary
offer (we will always offer the best salary we can afford, so there is
not much room for negotiation on salary) and discuss equity. If an
agreement is reached, we prepare an offer letter. If not, we consider
one of the other final-round candidates.

Once the candidate has *signed* and we have received the offer letter,
HR will notify the other final round candidates.

Save signed offer and CIIAA in confidential dropbox folder.  HR works
with new hire to get set up in TriNet, including required I9
verification stuff.

Do *not* add the new hire to GitHub, Slack, etc. until their first
day.  Even if they are eager to get started (which we hope!), we don't
want them doing their job until they start getting paid for it, and
this includes stuff like "just getting acquainted with docs" or
"lurking in chat rooms".  Those are work-time activities.  They're an
attractive nuisance while a person is closing out their current work
relationship and/or taking personal time between jobs.
