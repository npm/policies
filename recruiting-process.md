# npm, Inc.'s Recruiting Process

This document was once an internal document at npm, Inc.  Because it
is relevant to many people in our community, and we like transparency,
we have decided to open it up to the world.

There is no expectation or requirement that *you* hire people in this
way if you are not working at npm, Inc.  This is just how we do it.
If you [apply for a job here](https://www.npmjs.com/jobs), this may
provide some clue as to what to expect.

From here on out, "you" refers to the npm, Inc. employee who is
evaluating candidates for hire.

## npm's hiring philosophy

npm has a great brand for recruitment. Our applicants generally
mention three things they particularly like:

- Our focus on work-life balance and a humane working environment
- Caring about diversity
- That our product is open source

None of these things have anything to do with node.js or JavaScript,
and that's a great sign. Your conversations with applicants should
communicate the value we place on these things.

## Writing the job description

Some simple guidelines:

- Keep a conversational tone. Imagine you were describing the job to
  somebody over IM. This is not a contract.
- Maintain a bias towards inclusion. Applying for jobs is scary and
  hard work, so people read job descriptions looking for the *first
  thing that disqualifies them* so they don't need to apply. Don't
  give them this opportunity. *The purpose of a job description is to
  persuade someone to apply*, not to scare them off.
- Don't list a qualification (e.g. a degree) as required unless it
  really is required (we do not require degrees).
- Likewise, don't list a qualification if it is "nice to have". If we
  get a lot of applicants, then we'll screen for stuff that is nice to
  have after we get their resumes.
- Do not include a laundry list of technologies or applications. Any
  smart hire will be able to learn these.
- Talk about how the role will grow, and opportunities for training
  and mentorship. The number one thing people look for in a job is the
  opportunity to be better at it.
- Avoid [aggressive
  language](https://storify.com/kissane/job-listings-that-don-t-alienate)
  of any kind.
- Gendered language is obviously a no-go, and consider if your
  language is ageist or otherwise biased.

We have an [open source repo](https://github.com/npm/jobs) of former
job descriptions to help you.

## Recruitment process

Everyone who speaks to a candidate should put their notes in
[Lever](https://hire.lever.co/). The #recruitment channel on slack is
for discussing hiring pipeline status and recruitment plans, not
individual candidates. (i.e. it's okay to ask "is Jane coming for an
interview?" but not "I didn't like Jane because...").

1. Post the job description.
2. Wait at least 2 weeks after posting a job description before
   screening (don't screen as you go; screen as a batch).
3. All incoming applicants MUST be put into Lever. Every application
   gets a personal response indicating we received it and a rough
   timeline for screening (e.g. "about 1 week from now").
4. Hiring manager will read all available resumes and select 25-50% of
   those candidates for first-round screening. Anybody not selected is
   notified at this stage.
5. First-round screening is an informal, 20-30 minute discussion, by
   phone, Skype, or Google Hangout by the hiring manager. Select
   roughly 50% of these candidates for second-round screens. Anybody
   not selected is notified at this stage.
6. Second-round screening is 2 longer conversations, 45-60 minutes, by
   phone or conference if the applicant is remote, or in-person if
   they are local. These should be conducted by prospective
   team-mates, or failing that existing employees with relevant
   skillsets.
7. After second round, hiring manager meets with interviewers to
   select 1-3 candidates for a full team interview. Often by this
   point there will be one obviously best candidate, and it is fine to
   bring them in by themselves. Candidates not selected for the final
   round are notified at this stage.
8. Full team interview: the candidate comes in for lunch at noon (any
   day except Monday). Everyone meets them at lunch. After lunch,
   anyone who hasn't already spoken to the candidate can take a 30-45
   minute slot; it's up to you to ask for a slot if you want one.
9. After full team interview, hiring manager and their team will take
   everyone's notes into account and make a final decision. After
   selecting the best candidate, we do *not* yet notify the other
   candidates.
10. Hiring manager will consult with the selected candidate on salary,
   benefits, relocation, visa and any other issues to make sure there
   are no unexpected barriers to a hire and a reasonable start date,
   and make a salary recommendation to the CEO.
11. Reference checks: candidate supplies 3 names of people they've
    worked directly with; hiring manager has a discussion with at
    least 2. This is a final red-flag check and also gives the hiring
    manager a head-start on how to work best with the hire.
12. CEO will have a final conversation with the candidate, make salary
    offer (we will always offer the best salary we can afford, so
    there is not much room for negotiation on salary) and discuss
    equity. If an agreement is reached, we prepare an offer letter. If
    not, we consider one of the other final-round candidates.
13. Once the candidate has *signed* the offer letter, we notify the
    other final round candidates.

## How we interview

Read [Laurie's blog post on
hiring](http://seldo.com/weblog/2014/08/26/you_suck_at_technical_interviews)
for all the things *not* to do. The remainder of this section assumes
you've read this post.

We are looking for people who:

- can grasp complex technical subjects, because our product is one of
  those
- can clearly explain those subjects to others, because simplifying
  the complex is what we do
- can get things done, the best indicator of this being having already
  done things
- can quickly learn how to do this job; they don't need to already
  know how to do it
- show signs that they will get better at this job, i.e. future growth
  potential

npm values transparency and humanity, so as much as possible our
interviews are transparent and humane. Interviews are inherently
uncomfortable and scary, and nobody sounds smart when they are
uncomfortable and scared. Do your best to compensate for this. If you
think the candidate is doing well, be liberal about saying so. If the
candidate makes a mistake, try to prevent them spiralling into
meltdown by moving on quickly or giving positive feedback about some
other aspect of their performance.

Your interview should be a conversation. You are not trying to prove
that you know more about a topic than they do. You are not trying to
quiz them to make sure they know everything about a specific topic or
technology. You want to know if they can grasp complex concepts and
explain them clearly, because that is what a knowledge worker does.
