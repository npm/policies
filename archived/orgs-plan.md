# npm Orgs Payment Plan

This npm Orgs Payment Plan (this _Payment Plan_) supplements
the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc. (_npm_) at
<https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm Open Source
Terms_), as well as the terms for npm Paid Services (_npm Paid Services_)
at <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/private-terms> (_npm
Paid Services Terms_). This Payment Plan governs payment for
_Orgs_ and use of npm Paid Services by user
accounts added as members of those Orgs.

This Payment Plan was last updated on
August 6, 2018.
You can review prior versions at
<https://github.com/npm/policies/commits/master/orgs-plan.md>.

Under this Payment Plan, you may create one or more Orgs.

You will pay a minimum of $7.00 via your Payment Card when you create
an Org, and thereafter on the same day every month (your
_Billing Day_), until you delete the Org. This minimum payment
entitles you to a single member of the Org (a _New Paid Services
User_). You will pay $7.00 via your Payment Card per each additional
New Paid Services User that you add to an Org, counted and
billed on your Billing Day.

Note that the npm Paid Services Terms require everyone using npm Paid
Services to have an Account of their own, added under a Payment Plan.
You must add a New Paid Services User to an Org for each
person who will use npm Paid Services under this Payment Plan.
