# npm Private Packages Terms

These npm Private Packages Terms of Use (these _npm Private Packages
Terms_) supplement the terms for npm Open Source offered by npm, Inc.
(_npm_) at <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms> (_npm Open
Source Terms_). They govern access to and use of _npm Private Packages_,
the private package storage, delivery, organization management, and
access control features of <https://www.npmjs.com> (the _Website_) and
the npm public registry at <https://registry.npmjs.org> (the _Public
Registry_).

These npm Private Packages Terms were last updated on
December 1, 2015.
You can review prior versions at
<https://github.com/npm/policies/commits/master/private-terms.md>.

You may only access or use npm Private Packages by agreeing to the npm
Open Source Terms as supplemented by these npm Private Packages Terms. If
npm adds any additional functionality to npm Private Packages, you must
agree to these npm Private Packages Terms to use those new features, too.
You add these npm Private Packages Terms to your agreement with npm by
using npm Private Packages with your account (your _Account_). These
npm Private Packages Terms then become a part of the contract between you
and npm, until you or npm disable npm Private Packages for your Account.

## Use of npm Private Packages

npm will provide the private package storage and delivery features
and services described in the public documentation for npm Private
Packages at <https://docs.npmjs.com/private-modules/intro> (the _npm
Private Packages Documentation_). npm grants you permission to use
those features and services.

npm will also provide the organization management and access control
features described in the npm Private Packages Documentation, and grants
you permission to use those features and services, for npm Private
Packages "organizations" to which your Account belongs.

Permission to use npm Private Packages is not exclusive to you, and you
may not transfer it to others. These npm Private Packages Terms do not
give you permission to give others rights to use npm Private Packages.
If you agree to a Payment Plan that gives you that right, you may do so
only according to that Payment Plan.

## Payment for npm Private Packages

Both your permission to use npm Private Packages and npm's commitment to
provide npm Private Packages are subject to these npm Private Packages
Terms, the npm Open Source Terms, and payment for use of npm Private
Packages by your Account under a _Payment Plan_. The Payment Plans are:

1. the npm Solo Payment Plan at
   <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/solo-plan>

2. the npm Organizations Payment Plan at
   <https://www.npmjs.com/policies/organizations-plan>

You may not use npm Private Packages unless you or someone else has
agreed to a Payment Plan, enabled npm Private Packages for your Account
under that Payment Plan, and made payment.
